# false-position-method
False Position Method Solver (C++)
This C++ program finds the root of a polynomial function using the False Position Method (Regula Falsi). Unlike simple Bisection, this method uses a linear interpolation approach to find roots faster. The implementation demonstrates the use of recursion, pass-by-reference, and dynamic vectors.
